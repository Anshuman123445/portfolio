            <h3 class="section-title">FAB Lab HTML Module Learning Experience</h3>
            <div class="day-section">
                <p>During my three-day HTML module in the Fab Lab, I embarked on an exciting journey of web development learning. On the first day, I was introduced to the fundamental concepts of web technologies, exploring the basic differences between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I took my first steps in creating a web development environment by downloading and installing Visual Studio Code. Under the guidance of my instructor, I created my first module folder and crafted my initial HTML file, naming it index.html. The day was punctuated with a small quiz that helped me access my basic understanding, and I began to grasp the various HTML tags and their purposes.</p><hr>

            <div class="day-section">
                <p>The second day dived deeper into HTML's capabilities. I learned critical aspects of image handling, understanding that blank spaces in file paths can disrupt image rendering. I explored a variety of text formatting tags including <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> for line breaks, <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> for bold, <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> for italic, and <code>&lt;u&gt;</code> for underline text. The session expanded my knowledge of text manipulation with <code>&lt;big&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;small&gt;</code> tags for text sizing, <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> for horizontal rules, and <code>&lt;sub&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code> for subscript and superscript text. I was introduced to semantic HTML tags like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and gained improved insights into <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> tags. The exploration of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags helped me understand structural and inline content divisions.</p><hr>

            <div class="day-section">
                <p>On the final day, my learning focused on more complex HTML structures, particularly tables and forms. I dove into the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tag, learning its intricacies and how to create structured data representations. Forms became another area of concentration, where I improved my previous knowledge and worked extensively with form elements. I candidly acknowledge making some mistakes, especially with the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> tag, which became a valuable learning opportunity. These small errors during attempts to explain concepts to my batchmates actually enhanced my understanding. By the end of the third day, I had completed a basic introduction to HTML, feeling more confident in my web development skills and eager to continue learning.</p><hr>

            <div class="day-section">
                <p>Throughout these three days, the Fab Lab HTML module was not just about learning tags and syntax, but about understanding the foundational building blocks of web design and development. Each day brought new challenges, insights, and a growing appreciation for the art of creating web pages.</p>
